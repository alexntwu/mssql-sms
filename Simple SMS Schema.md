# How to Design Database for Simple FB-like Social Media Service Platform
Are you interested in designing a database for a social network, like Facebook?

Facebook is a popular website and designing a database for a site like Facebook is a common exercise, 
whether you're in a database course at college or want to practice your skills.

In this exercise, you'll start with a series of basic features of the system, and one-by-one we'll create a 
database design, adding to the design at each step.

The final design will meet the requirements of the features we have identified.

You can then expand on the design, and of course modify it if you want different requirements.
